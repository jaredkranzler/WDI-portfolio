           <p>Jared is a programmer, craftsman, and world traveler who has always had a strong passion for learning and gaining knowledge. He was raised with the mindset that knowledge is more valuable than money. His strong curiosity for how things work and the mechanisms that drive them, have pushed him towards deeper understandings of his trades and life.</p>
           <p>
           Jared began his journey through adulthood at Suffolk University in Madrid, Spain where he studied Art, Economics, and Psychology. He later transferred to his home city of Chicago where he received a BA in Digital Cinema from DePaul University. Since then, he has held various positions with several small businesses and has been an asset to multiple start-up companies where he has assisted in building their brands and infrastructure.
           </p>
           <p>
           The importance of technology in every day life today has lead Jared towards the fully immersive web development program at General Assembly. There he has learned to work in unison with his colleagues on projects and has moved forward to becoming a full-stack web developer.
